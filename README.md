# exoclaw 🦀

**Protocol-only AI agent framework. Bring your own everything.**

exoclaw is the skeleton. You provide the flesh — your LLM provider, your conversation storage, your channels, your tools. Nothing is baked in.

```
pip install exoclaw
```

One runtime dependency: `loguru`.

---

## Origin

exoclaw is a fork of [nanobot](https://github.com/NanobotAI/nanobot) with one goal: reduce the maintenance surface area by aligning on a defined set of extension points.

The original nanobot ships with batteries — a built-in LLM provider, memory system, cron scheduler, heartbeat service, MCP integration, Telegram/Discord channels, and more. That's convenient to start, but every baked-in feature is a PR waiting to happen. A Telegram API change breaks a cron bug fix release. An MCP SDK upgrade pulls in dependency conflicts for users who don't use MCP. The framework and its features are entangled.

exoclaw cuts the knot. The core defines five protocols and runs a loop. That's it. Everything else — conversation storage, channel integrations, tools, providers — lives in separate packages that you opt into. The core never changes because it has nothing to change.

**Why this benefits you, not just the maintainer:**

- **No surprise breakage.** A bug in someone else's Telegram integration can't break your log monitor. Each plugin fails independently.
- **No dependency drag.** You don't pull in MCP, croniter, and readability-lxml if you don't use them. Your dependency tree contains exactly what you chose.
- **Auditable trust.** The core is ~1,200 lines, mypy strict, 95% test coverage. You can read and understand it in an afternoon. When you trust exoclaw, you know exactly what you're trusting.
- **Composable upgrades.** Swap your conversation backend from files to Redis without touching the loop. Update your provider package when a new model ships without risking anything else.
- **Scoped blast radius.** When something breaks, it breaks in the package that owns it — not in the framework everyone shares.

## How it works

exoclaw is five protocols and a loop.

```
InboundMessage → Bus → AgentLoop → LLM → Tools → Bus → OutboundMessage → Channel
```

1. A **Channel** receives a message from the outside world and puts it on the **Bus**
2. The **AgentLoop** pulls it off the bus, asks the **Conversation** to build a prompt
3. The prompt goes to the **LLMProvider**, which returns a response
4. If the response has tool calls, the loop executes them via registered **Tools**
5. The final response goes back on the bus, and the **Channel** delivers it

Every one of those nouns is a protocol. Swap any of them out. No inheritance required.

## The Protocols

### `LLMProvider`

```python
class LLMProvider(Protocol):
    def get_default_model(self) -> str: ...

    async def chat(
        self,
        messages: list[dict[str, Any]],
        tools: list[dict[str, Any]],
        model: str,
        temperature: float,
        max_tokens: int,
        reasoning_effort: str | None,
    ) -> LLMResponse: ...
```

`LLMResponse` carries `.content`, `.tool_calls`, `.finish_reason`, `.has_tool_calls`.

**Plugin ideas:**
- `exoclaw-provider-litellm` — route to any model via LiteLLM
- `exoclaw-provider-anthropic` — direct Anthropic SDK
- `exoclaw-provider-openai` — direct OpenAI SDK
- `exoclaw-provider-ollama` — local models

---

### `Conversation`

```python
class Conversation(Protocol):
    async def build_prompt(
        self,
        session_id: str,
        message: str,
        *,
        channel: str | None = None,
        chat_id: str | None = None,
        media: list[str] | None = None,
        plugin_context: list[str] | None = None,
    ) -> list[dict[str, Any]]: ...

    async def record(self, session_id: str, new_messages: list[dict[str, Any]]) -> None: ...
    async def clear(self, session_id: str) -> bool: ...
    def list_sessions(self) -> list[dict[str, Any]]: ...
```

`build_prompt` returns the full message list sent to the LLM — system prompt, history, new user message. `plugin_context` strings are collected from tools that implement `system_context()` and injected into the system prompt.

**Plugin ideas:**
- `exoclaw-conversation` — file-backed sessions, JSONL history, LLM memory consolidation
- `exoclaw-conversation-redis` — Redis-backed for multi-instance deployments
- `exoclaw-conversation-postgres` — durable storage with vector memory

---

### `Tool`

```python
class Tool(Protocol):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str: ...

    @property
    def description(self) -> str: ...

    @property
    def parameters(self) -> dict[str, Any]: ...

    async def execute(self, **kwargs: Any) -> str: ...
```

Tools are registered at construction time via `Nanobot(tools=[...])`. The loop calls `tool.execute(**args)` and feeds results back into the LLM context.

**Optional hooks** (duck-typed — implement if you need them):

```python
def on_inbound(self, msg: InboundMessage) -> None:
    """Called before each message is processed. Update per-turn state here."""

def system_context(self) -> str:
    """Return a string injected into the system prompt every turn."""

async def cancel_by_session(self, session_key: str) -> int:
    """Cancel running work for a session. Return count cancelled. Called on /stop."""

sent_in_turn: bool  # If True after execute(), loop suppresses the normal reply
```

**Plugin ideas:**
- `exoclaw-tools-mcp` — connect MCP servers, register each as a Tool
- `exoclaw-tools-web` — web search and page fetching
- `exoclaw-tools-shell` — sandboxed shell execution
- `exoclaw-tools-files` — workspace file operations
- `exoclaw-tools-memory` — read/write long-term memory files
- `exoclaw-tools-message` — send messages to other channels (sets `sent_in_turn=True`)
- `exoclaw-tools-cron` — schedule reminders (implements `system_context()` + `on_inbound()`)
- `exoclaw-tools-skills` — load SKILL.md files from a workspace directory and inject via `system_context()`

---

### `Channel`

```python
class Channel(Protocol):
    name: str

    async def start(self, bus: Bus) -> None:
        """Connect to the platform and begin receiving messages."""

    async def stop(self) -> None:
        """Disconnect and release resources."""

    async def send(self, msg: OutboundMessage) -> None:
        """Deliver an outbound message to the platform."""
```

The bus is injected at `start()` time — channels are constructed without it, so synthetic channels (heartbeat, cron triggers) can be created before the bus exists.

**Plugin ideas:**
- `exoclaw-channel-telegram` — Telegram bot
- `exoclaw-channel-discord` — Discord bot
- `exoclaw-channel-slack` — Slack app
- `exoclaw-channel-cli` — interactive terminal REPL
- `exoclaw-channel-heartbeat` — timed pings that trigger background agent tasks
- `exoclaw-channel-cron` — cron-scheduled messages routed to the agent

---

### `Bus`

```python
class Bus(Protocol):
    async def publish_inbound(self, msg: InboundMessage) -> None: ...
    async def consume_inbound(self) -> InboundMessage: ...
    async def publish_outbound(self, msg: OutboundMessage) -> None: ...
    async def consume_outbound(self) -> OutboundMessage: ...
```

The default `MessageBus` is a pair of asyncio queues — sufficient for single-process deployments.

**Plugin ideas:**
- `exoclaw-bus-redis` — Redis pub/sub for multi-process or distributed agents
- `exoclaw-bus-nats` — NATS for high-throughput pipelines

---

## Usage

```python
import asyncio
from exoclaw import Nanobot

# All of these come from plugin packages — not from exoclaw itself
from exoclaw_provider_litellm import LiteLLMProvider
from exoclaw_conversation import DefaultConversation
from exoclaw_channel_telegram import TelegramChannel
from exoclaw_tools_web import WebSearchTool
from exoclaw_tools_mcp import connect_mcp

async def main():
    # MCP tools require async setup — connect before constructing the app
    mcp_tools = await connect_mcp({
        "filesystem": {"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."]},
    })

    app = Nanobot(
        provider=LiteLLMProvider(model="anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"),
        conversation=DefaultConversation(workspace="~/.mybot/workspace"),
        channels=[
            TelegramChannel(token="..."),
        ],
        tools=[
            WebSearchTool(),
            *mcp_tools,
        ],
    )
    await app.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Writing a Tool

```python
from exoclaw.agent.tools.protocol import ToolBase  # optional mixin

class WeatherTool(ToolBase):
    name = "get_weather"
    description = "Get the current weather for a city."
    parameters = {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "city": {"type": "string", "description": "City name"},
        },
        "required": ["city"],
    }

    async def execute(self, city: str) -> str:
        # fetch weather...
        return f"It's sunny in {city}, 22°C."

    def system_context(self) -> str:
        return "You have access to real-time weather data via get_weather."
```

No base class required — `ToolBase` is an optional mixin that gives you parameter casting, validation, and schema generation for free. Implement the four attributes and `execute()` directly if you prefer.

## Writing a Channel

```python
from exoclaw.bus.events import InboundMessage, OutboundMessage
from exoclaw.bus.protocol import Bus

class WebhookChannel:
    name = "webhook"

    async def start(self, bus: Bus) -> None:
        self._bus = bus
        # start your web server, register routes, etc.

    async def stop(self) -> None:
        # shut down web server
        pass

    async def send(self, msg: OutboundMessage) -> None:
        # deliver msg.content to the webhook target
        pass

    async def _on_request(self, payload: dict) -> None:
        await self._bus.publish_inbound(InboundMessage(
            channel=self.name,
            sender_id=payload["user_id"],
            chat_id=payload["chat_id"],
            content=payload["text"],
        ))
```

---

## Plugin system

Tools and channels can inject context into the system prompt each turn via `system_context()`:

```python
class CronTool:
    name = "cron"
    # ...

    def system_context(self) -> str:
        jobs = self._list_active_jobs()
        return f"# Scheduled Jobs\n\n{jobs}"
```

The loop collects `system_context()` from all registered tools before each `build_prompt` call and passes the results as `plugin_context`. Each plugin owns its own section of the system prompt — no static template files needed.
